No more being chained outside. No more sleeping on the cold, hard ground. No more going to sleep hungry. That\'s the best part, cause I really like food! At my foster home, I have my own soft bed and my own den, they call a crate. It\'s pretty nice I guess, as long as I can have my Nylabone to chew on! It\'s a pretty nice place to sleep in at night. It beats sleeping outside, I can tell you that! I go for leisurely walks every day. I like that too! I went to a clinic yesterday and they gave me some medicine to get rid of the worms in my belly.',

It does not wake anyone up, we have just heard it when he goes to sleep while we are still awake.) Boomer here again, yeah see these new people right? Well they got something called A/C.
